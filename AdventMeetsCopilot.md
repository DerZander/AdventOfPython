## Solved problem directly
It solved directly the first problem of the Advent of Code in 2016 of the 1 Day. 
My promt was:
```
Solve the first one
```

IÂ´ve marked the "solution.py", "test_input.txt" and "description.txt"


The second had some problems but with copy the error message and have a lookup at the code i could solve it again with github copilot.
